description: " QPDF is a command-line tool and C++ library that performs  content-preserving transformations on PDF files.  It supports linearization, encryption, and numerous other  features. It can also be used for splitting and merging  files, creating PDF files (but you have to supply all the  content yourself), and inspecting files for study or  analysis. QPDF does not render PDFs or perform text  extraction, and it does not contain higher-level interfaces  for working with page contents. It is a low-level tool for  working with the structure of PDF files and can be a  valuable tool for anyone who wants to do programmatic or  command-line-based manipulation of PDF files."
